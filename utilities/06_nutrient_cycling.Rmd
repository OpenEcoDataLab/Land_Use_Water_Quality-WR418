## What is a nutrient?

Nutrients are the substances that help life survive, grow, and reproduce. These
can be complex carbohydrates used for energy like starches or amino acids used to
build proteins, or we can think of nutrients as the elements that make these complex
life-building blocks. Frequently when talking about life, we focus on a group of 
elements that are most common in almost all biologically relevant molecules. This
group is called CHNOPS for Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur. 
Together these elements make up 98% of living tissues. The video below does a good 
job explaining why these elements (and many others) are vital to life:

The elements vital to life are constantly cycling in and out of life forms and into
abiotic forms. The carbon molecules in a peach are converted to CO$_2$ when we eat
the peach, break it down into it's component parts, and respire the sugar, using the 
energy to maintain ourselves. The movement of this carbon molecule into our bodies, and
then into the atmosphere, and, eventually, back into another plant is called a biogeochemical 
cycle. A full discusiong of biogeochemical cycling is beyond the scope of this course
but this is a great [book](https://www.elsevier.com/books/biogeochemistry/schlesinger/978-0-12-385874-0) if you are interested. Instead, we will focus on a subset of biogeochmical cycles called
nutrient cycles, in particular the Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles, which have a 
heavy influence on water quality. 

## Interacting nutrient cycles

### Liebig's law of the minimum

Nutrient cycles interact in a variety of ways, but some of our earliest concepts 
of how nutrient cycles depend on each other was from ideas from agriculture. One 
such concept is called ["Liebig's law of the minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebig%27s_law_of_the_minimum) which states
that plants grow not in response to the total amount of resources they have 
(water, nutrients, light, etc...) but in proportion to the most scarce resource 
(the limiting nutrient). So if a plant has all the N it needs but not enough P
it will only grow to the point where it runs out of P. While we have a more rich 
understanding of coupled nutrient cycling, this concept is still a useful way 
for starting to think about how one nutrient can impact others.

### Redfield ratio

Another critical way we understand nutrient cycling is by understanding ecological
stoichiometry, which is the study of how lifeforms require elements in certain ratios
and how they change in order to meet these requirements. The idea that lifeforms have 
specific ratios of elements they need to maintain comes from early research by [Alfred C. Redfield in 1934](http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/summercourse/2012/documents/bronk_05-30-12/Redfield_1934.pdf). Through oceanic surveys of C, N, and P content in marine biomass Redfield found that there was a consistent ratio of these elements to each other, across the world's oceans. We
now call this ratio the redfield ratio which as originally stated was 106 C:16 N:1 P. Where 
there is 106 moles of carbon, for every 16 moles of Nitrogen, for every 1 mol of Phosphorus in 
the biomass of marine life. This ratio varies across different lifeforms, but it is another way
of thinking about how nutrient cycles might interact.

## The Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles

Nitrogen and Phosphorus are vital elements for life and their biogeochemical cycles have been 
heavily altered by people, with severe consequences for water quality.

## Excess nutrients cause water quality problems. 

In order to sustain the world's growing population, we need to consistently supply
nutrients to our croplands so that our crops can grow. Before 1900, most of this fertilizer
was simply animal waste or manure direclty applied to land. With limited supplies of manure,
there was a limited apacity for agriculture to maximize yields on croplands. Until the Haber-Bosch process was invented, which dramatically increased our capacity to deliver Nitrogen compounds directly to plants for croplands. 


### Haber-Bosch

The Haber-Bosch process coupled with the globalized mining of Phosphorus has made it so that 
in many parts of the world these nutrients no longer limit plant growth. 

### Phosphate mining

### Excess nutrients

The readily available N and P generated from Haber-Bosch and global phosphate mining
has helped feed a growing global population, but frequently fertilizers end up 
running off into adjacent water bodies. Causing algae blooms and subsequent eutrophication 
in lakes, estuaries, and the near-coast environment.

## Modern nutrient water quality problems

The problem of excess nutrients in freshwaters is a global problem that exists
in almost every nation. Lots of modern research efforts are aimed at assessing the 
extent of excess nutrients in the world's rivers, lakes, and coastal margins. Some of my 
favorite papers or summaries of papers on the subject are here:

And many many more. 

## Redox

For biogeochemical cycles generally, and for nutrient cycling especially, redox 
reactions are the chemical reactions that govern the transformations, transport,
control, and impact of nutrients on waters.
