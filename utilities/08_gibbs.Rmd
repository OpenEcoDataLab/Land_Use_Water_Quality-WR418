# Gibbs free energy in aquatic environments


## Energy in chemical reactions

As previously described, redox reactions power life by releasing energy when 
electrons move from one compound or element to another. These reactions can
yield different amounts of energy to the lifeform depending on the reagents involved.
The total energy yield of a reaction is captured by the concept of Gibbs free 
energy $\Delta G$. You may have come across the idea of Gibbs free energy when
thinking about whether or not a reaction will proceed spontaneously where: 

- $\Delta$G < 0 will be a spontaneous reaction
- $\Delta$G > 0 will be non-spontaneous (requires energy input). 

And for a general review of Gibbs free energy you can go [here](http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch21/gibbs.php). And
watch the video below that explains energy yield in the context of electrochemistry 
(batteries)

But we are really focused on the Gibbs free energy yield in living systems. 

### Standard Gibbs free energy

Over decades scientists have figured out the standard gibbs free energy of formation
for a very long list of elements and compounds. We can use these free energy
estimates of compounds to estimate the total energy yield of a reaction using the 
following equation: 

$G^o = {\sum}\Delta G_{products} - {\sum}\Delta G_{reactants}$ 

Where $G^o$ is the standard free energy yield of a reaction at $25^o$ and 1 
atmosphere pressure with 1 mole of that substance. We can use the above equation
to estimate how much energy a microbe may get out of a reaction. For example the
reaction: $3NO_{(g)} -> N_2O_{(g)} + NO_{2(g)}$ with $\Delta G_f^o$ (standard 
gibbs free energy of formation values of):

- $NO_{(g)}$ = 86.55 kJ/mol

- $N_2O_{(g)}$ = 104.18 kJ/mol

- $NO_{2(g)}$ = 51.29 kJ/mol

Plugging these numbers into the equation we get

$\Delta G^o = (1 * 104.18 kJ/mol + 1 * 51.29 kJ/mol) - (3 * 86.55)$

$\Delta G^o = -104.18 kJ$

Knowing that final standard free energy yield gives us a sense of how much
energy a lifeform can get out of a redox reaction. But these numbers are
at standard state. What about non-standard temperatures or concentrations? 


## Non-standard $\Delta G$ yield

The above equation gives the standard free energy yield with 1 mole of each
reactant at $25^o$C and 1 atmosphere pressure. Of course, almost all reactions 
in nature will not be at standard conditions like these. To calculate this "actual" 
Gibbs free energy in the environment we need to use one last equation. 
If we had the generic chemical reaction: 
$aA+bB = cC+dD$

Then we would estimate the actual gibbs free energy yield of a reaction as: 

$\Delta G = \Delta G^o + RT ln\left(\frac{([C]^c*[D]^d)}{([A]^a*[B]^b)}\right)$

Where $\Delta G^o$ is the standard free energy yield of a reaction (calculated 
above), R is the universal gas constant $R = 0.008314 \frac{kJ}{mol K}$ and K
is temperature in Kelvin $K= Temp^oC + 273.15$

## Redox ladder

Knowing the $Delta G$ of a reaction can tell us which microbes are likely to be
active under different environmental conditions. This is because microbes can use
a variety of compounds as so-called "final electron acceptors." Depending on the
final electron acceptor used by microbes the metabolism of energy bearing compounds
like sugar or acetic acid will generate different amounts of energy. The microbes
using the most energy-efficient pathway (i.e. the most negative $Delta G$) will
"win" and likely that reaction will be dominant in those environmental conditions.
The most efficient final electron acceptor is oxygen, but there are a large variety
of other final electron acceptors with varying energy yields. To capture these 
complex ideas of energy yield, biogeochemists use a term called the "redox ladder."
This term indicates the declining energy yield as microbial communities
switch final electron acceptors.

The above image is from this very thorough website at [ESF](https://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/Limnology/redox.html) which you can use 
for additional review. 

As microbial communities descend down the redox ladder, there is increasingly less
free energy produced. The order of electron acceptors from most energy to least 
energy is: oxygen, then nitrate, then manganese (not shown above),
then iron, then sulfate, and finally, carbon dioxide. The redox ladder is mostly 
a conceptual idea of how microbial communities are organized by redox reactions 
and energy yields, but frequently the redox ladder is mapped directly onto physical
space. For example, near the sediment surface of a shallow pond, there is oxygen
exchange with the water column and oxygen is available as the most efficient
final elecron acceptor. But as you go deeper into the sediment, the oxygen is consumed
by microbes closer to the surface, and thre is eventually so little that it is
more efficient to use nitrate ($NO_3^-$) as a final electron acceptor. Going even
deeper the microbes run out of nitrate and switch to iron reduction, and so on. 
A good example of how the redox ladder maps to physical space is called a 
Winogradsky column

## Redox potential

The redox ladder is one way of capturing the reactions that are likely to occur,
but there are two other ways. First is to simpley describe the environment as 
oxygen-rich or not. An oxic environment is likely to have oxygen as the final
electron acceptor, suboxic environments can have a mix of oxygen and other 
final electron acceptors, while microbes in anoxic (no oxygen) environments will
rely on non-oxygen electron acceptors (like $NO_3^-$). 

Another, more quantitative way to describe the redox environment of natural waters
(like lakes or ponds) sediments, or aquifers is to directly measure the reduction 
potential in the environment. This $E_h$ scale goes from -1 to 1 with 1 representing
oxic environments where reduction is likely to occur and -1 representing reduced 
environments with limited potential for reduction. This excellent [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es9026248) (by a CSU professor, Thomas 
Borch) provides a clear explanation 
of how reduction potential and redox more generally control reactions 
that govern water quality, with a key figure below:

It's beyond the scope of this course (at present) to deeply define the reduction
potential scale but wikipedia does a pretty good [job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_potential) if you are curious.

## Redox and nutrients 

The paper above by Borch and others outlines a variety of ways that redox
conditions control water quality, but I wanted to highlight specifically two ways
that redox conditions control nutrient concentrations in inland waters. 

### Nitrogen cycling and redox

First, as highlighted previously the nitrogen cycle includes a critical step where
biologically-available nitrogen in the form of $NO_3^-$ or $NH_3$ is eventually 
converted to biologically inert $N_2$. This removal of nitrogen from inland waters
is a critical way that we can reduce nutrient pollution in lakes, rivers, and
the near-coastal environment. For the denitrification to occur, microbes need
anoxic conditions so that $NO_3^-$ reduction (denitrification) is the most 
efficient final electron acceptor. But, in order to remove all of the $NH_3$ from
the system as well, a nitrification step must first occur where $NH_3$ is converted
to $NO_3^-$. This process where $NH_3$ is used as electron donor (energy source)
requires oxygen, so full removal of nitrogen from inland waters requires both 
oxic and anoxic conditions. These processes (with a more advanced picture of 
the redox reactions involved) are captured in the figure below from this 
very helpful explaner on the [Nitrogen cycle.](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-nitrogen-cycle-processes-players-and-human-15644632)

### Phosphorus 

Unlike the nitrogen cycle, Phosphorus has no gaseous phase on earth, so removing 
it from inland waters either requires it to be taken up by plants or other lifeforms
or for it to be bound up by other minerals. In many lakes, the most
common form of P binding is when $PO_4^{3-}$ with it's charge of -3 binds 
up with aqueous iron ($Fe^{3+}$). This effectively removes the Phosphorus from 
the water column and makes it inaccessible to algae. However, once the $FePO_4$
sinks to the bottom of a lake or wetland, the iron can be reduced to $Fe^{2+}$ 
and the phosphate will then desorb from the iron, being released into the
environment as bioavailable P. As a result, Phosphorus dynamics in inland waters
are deeply dependent on redox reactions and conditions. 

Redox conditions are some of the ultimate controls on nutrient cycling, but what
happens when excess nutrients reach the coast or lakes? Frequently, it causes
harmful algal blooms.
