## Housekeeping

- Thursday we will go over test

- Thursday, we will also go over final outline

- Homework over spring break will be reading some papers

- There will be a quiz coming back from break on those papers

- Questions for me? 


## COVID-19

- My #1 concern is your health 

- If you are feeling ill, stay home

- Reach out if you need support

- Get ready for online delivery


## Online delivery

- Flipped class

- Online discussions

- R work-time in class

## What do you already know?

- With a small group, think of a metal or trace element you think (or know) is a pollutant

- How does this metal get into surface waters? 

- Why is it a pollutant of concern? Is it directly toxic to aquatic life, to humans? 

- What is the mechanism of toxicity? Does it create free radicals that can
attack DNA and cell walls? Does it get mistaken for a similar element
and folded into our proteins incorrectly? 

## Selenium {.build}

Both an old problem:

and a very modern [issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/science/earth/mutated-trout-raise-new-concerns-over-selenium.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all)

## Selenium

- Mobilized by mining, coal-ash, and agriculture (by increasing weathering rates of Se bearing bedrock)

- Mostly non-toxic to people, but highly toxic to fish and birds. 

- Disrupts DNA in embyros 

- Can bioaccumulate 

- EPA limit 1.5 $\mu g/L$ in lakes, 3$\mu g/L$

## Selenium 

- Problem in mining regions of east, western CA, and CA

## Selenium phases

- Most readily taken up in the foodweb as selenate ($SeO_4^{2-}$)

## Cadmium

- Non-essential (not a nutrient). Toxic at low levels.

- Historically very low concentrations in most river basins

- Poisonous to humans

- Humans now mobilize >90% of Cadmium through mining activities

- Toxicity is heavily dependent on concentration of other ions ($Ca^{2+},Mg^{2+}$)

- In freshwaters acute toxicity (1-hour) is 1.8 $\mu g/L$ and chronic (4 days) is 0.72$\mu g/L$. 

- In estuaries/ocean: acute: 33 $\mu g/L$ and chronic: 7.9 $\mu g/L$

- Why would cadmium toxicity be dependent on other ions? 


## Chromium

## Chromium 

- Toxic to both humans and aquatic life at high concentrations but
a vital micronutrient for insulin function at low-concentration. 

- Mobility and toxicity is highly dependent on oxidation state

- $Cr^{3+}$ is mostly less-mobile and less toxic. 

- $Cr^{6+}$ is more mobile and more toxic

- Natural weathering product but elevated by human activities and spills

## Hofmeister series {.build}

$F^-$ = $SO_4^{2-}$ > $Cl^-$ > $NO_3^-$ > $Br^-$

$NH_4^+$ > $K^+$ > $Na^+$ > $Mg^{2+}$ > $Ca^{2+}$

## And on and on

## How do you find out about trace element contamination?
