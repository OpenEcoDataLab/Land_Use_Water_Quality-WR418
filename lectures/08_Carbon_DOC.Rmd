## Key ideas from Thursday

- Industrial plants often use river or reservoir water to cool down industrial processes

- This can create "thermal pollution": water that returns to the river/lake at a warmer temperature than it came in at. 

- Thermal pollution causes all kinds of problems from direct toxicity to causing more or more harmful algae blooms

- Algae blooms can actually be cyanobacterial blooms, which are typically more dangerous to people

- Bloom states can be self-sustaining because of internal ecosystem feedbacks


## Key ideas for today

- Dissolved forms of carbon play an important role in the global carbon cycle

- They also are critical for how lakes and rivers function

- DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon) can interfere with water treatment plants and create problems for drinking water

- There are two ways DOC enters into waterways: 1) Allocthonous inputs (coming from terrestrial sources like decaying leaves) and 2) Autocthonous inputs like internal production of DOC from algae

- Depending on the form, DOC can be highly reactive or more or less inert.

## Carbon as light altering dye

- Carbon can be colored (Colored Dissolved Organic Matter)

- This alters the light regime in rivers and lakes

## Where does the DOC come from? 

- Allocthonous 

- Autocthonous
